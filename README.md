:warning: :warning: I'm no longer actively working on this repo. Instead, I've been converting existing chapters into ebooks (see [ebook section](#ebook) below for links), available under the same license. These ebooks are better formatted, updated for newer versions of the software, includes exercises, solutions, etc. Once all the chapters have been converted, I'll be archiving this repo.

CAT(1)                           User Commands                          CAT(1)

NAME
       cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output

SYNOPSIS
       cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
...
```

* For below examples, `marks_201*` files contain 3 fields delimited by TAB
* To avoid formatting issues, TAB has been converted to spaces using `col -x` while pasting the output here

<br>

#### <a name="concatenate-files"></a>Concatenate files

* One or more files can be given as input and hence a lot of times, `cat` is used to quickly see contents of small single file on terminal
* To save the output of concatenation, just redirect stdout

```bash
$ ls
marks_2015.txt  marks_2016.txt  marks_2017.txt

$ cat marks_201*
Name    Maths   Science
foo     67      78
bar     87      85
Name    Maths   Science
foo     70      75
bar     85      88
Name    Maths   Science
foo     68      76
bar     90      90

$ # save stdout to a file
$ cat marks_201* > all_marks.txt
```

<br>

#### <a name="accepting-input-from-stdin"></a>Accepting input from stdin

```bash
$ # combining input from stdin and other files
$ printf 'Name\tMaths\tScience \nbaz\t56\t63\nbak\t71\t65\n' | cat - marks_2015.txt
Name    Maths   Science
baz     56      63
bak     71      65
Name    Maths   Science
foo     67      78
bar     87      85

$ # - can be placed in whatever order is required
$ printf 'Name\tMaths\tScience \nbaz\t56\t63\nbak\t71\t65\n' | cat marks_2015.txt -
Name    Maths   Science
foo     67      78
bar     87      85
Name    Maths   Science
baz     56      63
bak     71      65
```

<br>

#### <a name="squeeze-consecutive-empty-lines"></a>Squeeze consecutive empty lines

```bash
$ printf 'hello\n\n\nworld\n\nhave a nice day\n'
hello


world

have a nice day
$ printf 'hello\n\n\nworld\n\nhave a nice day\n' | cat -s
hello

world

have a nice day
```

<br>

#### <a name="prefix-line-numbers"></a>Prefix line numbers

```bash
$ # number all lines
$ cat -n marks_201*
     1  Name    Maths   Science
     2  foo     67      78
     3  bar     87      85
     4  Name    Maths   Science
     5  foo     70      75
     6  bar     85      88
     7  Name    Maths   Science
     8  foo     68      76
     9  bar     90      90

$ # number only non-empty lines
$ printf 'hello\n\n\nworld\n\nhave a nice day\n' | cat -sb
     1	hello

     2	world

     3	have a nice day
```

* For more numbering options, check out the command `nl`

```bash
$ whatis nl
nl (1)               - number lines of files
```

<br>

#### <a name="viewing-special-characters"></a>Viewing special characters

* End of line identified by `$`
* Useful for example to see trailing spaces

```bash
$ cat -E marks_2015.txt 
Name    Maths   Science $
foo     67      78$
bar     87      85$
```

* TAB identified by `^I`

```bash
$ cat -T marks_2015.txt 
Name^IMaths^IScience 
foo^I67^I78
bar^I87^I85
```

* Non-printing characters
* See [Show Non-Printing Characters](http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/unix/upt/ch25_07.htm) for more detailed info

```bash
$ # NUL character
$ printf 'foo\0bar\0baz\n' | cat -v
foo^@bar^@baz

$ # to check for dos-style line endings
$ printf 'Hello World!\r\n' | cat -v
Hello World!^M

$ printf 'Hello World!\r\n' | dos2unix | cat -v
Hello World!
```

* the `-A` option is equivalent to `-vET`
* the `-e` option is equivalent to `-vE`
* If `dos2unix` and `unix2dos` are not available, see [How to convert DOS/Windows newline (CRLF) to Unix newline (\n)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2613800/how-to-convert-dos-windows-newline-crlf-to-unix-newline-n-in-a-bash-script)

<br>

#### <a name="writing-text-to-file"></a>Writing text to file

```bash
$ cat > sample.txt
This is an example of adding text to a new file using cat command.
Press Ctrl+d on a newline to save and quit.

$ cat sample.txt 
This is an example of adding text to a new file using cat command.
Press Ctrl+d on a newline to save and quit.
```

<br>

#### <a name="tac"></a>tac

```bash
$ whatis tac
tac (1)              - concatenate and print files in reverse

$ seq 3 | tac
3
2
1

$ tac marks_2015.txt 
bar	87	85
foo	67	78
Name	Maths	Science 
```

* Useful in cases where logic is easier to write when working on reversed file
* Consider this made up log file, many **Warning** lines but need to extract only from last such **Warning** upto **Error** line

```bash
$ cat report.log 
blah blah
Warning: something went wrong
more blah
whatever
Warning: something else went wrong
some text
some more text
Error: something seriously went wrong
blah blah blah

$ tac report.log | sed -n '/Error:/,/Warning:/p' | tac
Warning: something else went wrong
some text
some more text
Error: something seriously went wrong
```

* Similarly, if characters in lines have to be reversed, use the `rev` command

```bash
$ whatis rev
rev (1)              - reverse lines characterwise
```

<br>

#### <a name="useless-use-of-cat"></a>Useless use of cat

* `cat` is used so frequently to view contents of a file that somehow users think other commands cannot handle file input
* [UUOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)#Useless_use_of_cat)
* [Useless Use of Cat Award](http://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html)

```bash
$ cat report.log | grep -E 'Warning|Error'
Warning: something went wrong
Warning: something else went wrong
Error: something seriously went wrong
$ grep -E 'Warning|Error' report.log
Warning: something went wrong
Warning: something else went wrong
Error: something seriously went wrong
```

* Use [input redirection](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/howto/redirection_tutorial) if a command doesn't accept file input

```bash
$ cat marks_2015.txt | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'
name    maths   science
foo     67      78
bar     87      85
$ tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' < marks_2015.txt
name    maths   science
foo     67      78
bar     87      85
```

* However, `cat` should definitely be used where **concatenation** is needed

```bash
$ grep -c 'foo' marks_201*
marks_2015.txt:1
marks_2016.txt:1
marks_2017.txt:1

$ # concatenation allows to get overall count in one-shot in this case
$ cat marks_201* | grep -c 'foo'
3
```

## <a name="less"></a>less

```bash
$ whatis less
less (1)             - opposite of more

$ # By default, pager is used to display the man pages
$ # and usually, pager is linked to less command
$ type pager less
pager is /usr/bin/pager
less is /usr/bin/less

$ realpath /usr/bin/pager 
/bin/less
$ realpath /usr/bin/less
/bin/less
$ diff -s /usr/bin/pager /usr/bin/less
Files /usr/bin/pager and /usr/bin/less are identical
```

* `cat` command is NOT suitable for viewing contents of large files on the Terminal
* `less` displays contents of a file, automatically fits to size of Terminal, allows scrolling in either direction and other options for effective viewing
* Usually, `man` command uses `less` command to display the help page
* The navigation commands are similar to `vi` editor

<br>

#### <a name="navigation-commands"></a>Navigation commands

Commonly used commands are given below, press `h` for summary of options

* `g` go to start of file
* `G` go to end of file
* `q` quit
* `/pattern` search for the given pattern in forward direction
* `?pattern` search for the given pattern in backward direction
* `n` go to next pattern
* `N` go to previous pattern

<br>

#### <a name="a-better-tail"></a>A better tail

```bash
less +F sample.log
```

* Opens streaming file and updates in real time (similar to `tail -f sample.log`)
* Ctrl+c will pause update and allow normal less navigation command usage
* `F` will jump to end of file and resume streaming updates
* Note: You must stop streaming (Ctrl+c) before attempting to `q`uit less

<br>

#### <a name="edit-file-easier-and-faster"></a>Edit file easier and faster

* When viewing any file with less, `v` will open the file in the editor as defined by the `EDITOR` environment variable (will be `vi` by default)
* When you quit out of the editor, it returns you back to less

<br>

#### <a name="multiple-files-with-less"></a>Multiple files with less at same time

```bash
less sample1.log sample2.log sample3.log
```

* Views multiple files in the order presented on CLI
* `:n` to view the next file in list
* `:p` to view the previous file in list

<br>

#### <a name="further-reading-for-less"></a>Further Reading for less

* See `man less` for detailed info on commands and options. For example:
    * `-s` option to squeeze consecutive blank lines
    * `-N` option to prefix line number
* `less` command is an [improved version](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/604/isnt-less-just-more) of `more` command
* [differences between most, more and less](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/81129/what-are-the-differences-between-most-more-and-less)

15) Adios amigo

$ # some versions of tail allow to skip explicit n character
$ tail -5 sample.txt 
11) No doubt you like it too
12) 
13) Much ado about nothing
14) He he he
15) Adios amigo
```

* when number is prefixed with `+` sign, all lines are fetched from that particular line number to end of file

```bash
$ tail -n +10 sample.txt 
10) Not a bit funny
11) No doubt you like it too
12) 
13) Much ado about nothing
14) He he he

$ seq 13 17 | tail -n +3
15
16
17
```

#### <a name="characterwise-tail"></a>characterwise tail

* Note that this works byte wise and not suitable for multi-byte character encodings

```bash
$ # last three characters including the newline character
$ echo 'Hi there!' | tail -c3
e!

$ # excluding the first character
$ echo 'Hi there!' | tail -c +2
i there!
```
